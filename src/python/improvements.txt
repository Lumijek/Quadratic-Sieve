Improvements:
1. Sieve from [sqrt(n) - I / 2, sqrt(n) + I / 2] instead of [sqrt(n), sqrt(n) + I] -- X DONE
2. Use logarithms for approximations instead of division -- X DONE
3. Don't use small prime factors -- X DONE
4. Implement the Large Prime Variation of the Quadratic Sieve
5. Implement multiple polynomials
6. Implement self initialization for multiple polynomials
7. Implement the Double Large Prime Variation of the Quadratic Sieve
